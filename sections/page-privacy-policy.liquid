            <br />
            <br />
            We collect information about you when you use the Service, including information you provide when you
            access our content. The categories of information we collect include:
            <br />
            <br />
            Transaction Data relating to the minting, purchase, sale, and transfer of non-fungible tokens (“NFTs”),
            including information regarding your digital or cryptocurrency wallet and the purchase price, date, and
            location of the transactions.
            <br />
            <br />
            Contact Data, including your email address
            <br />
            <br />
            You may choose to voluntarily provide other information to us that we do not request, and, in such
            instances, you are solely responsible for such information.
            <br />
            <br />
            Information Collected Automatically.
            <br />
            <br />
            In addition, we automatically collect information when you use the Service. The categories of information
            we automatically collect include:
            <br />
            <br />
            Service Use Data, including data about features you use, pages you visit, the time of day you browse, and
            your referring and exiting pages.
            <br />
            <br />
            Device Data, including data about the type of device or browser you use, your device’s operating software,
            your internet service provider, your device’s regional and language settings, and device identifiers such as
            IP address.
            <br />
            <br />
            Location Data, including non-precise location data (such as location derived from an IP address or data
            that indicates a city or postal code level).
            <br />
            <br />
            The types of tracking technologies we use to automatically collect this information include:
            <br />
            <br />
            Cookies, which are small data files stored on your browser that save data about your visit. Cookies often
            include a unique identifier (e.g., cookie #123). We use two types of cookies: session cookies and persistent
            cookies. Session cookies make it easier for you to navigate our website and expire when you close your
            browser. Persistent cookies help with personalizing your experience, remembering your preferences, and
            supporting security features. Persistent cookies may remain on your device for extended periods of time,
            and expire on a set expiration date or when they are deleted manually.
            <br />
            <br />
            Pixels (also known as web beacons), which is code embedded in a service that sends information about
            your use to a server. There are various types of pixels, including image pixels (which are small graphic
            images) and JavaScript pixels (which contains JavaScript code). When you access a service that contains a
            pixel, the pixel may permit us or a separate entity to drop or read cookies on your browser, or collect
            other information about your visit.
            <br />
            <br />

            Device Fingerprinting, which is the process of analyzing and combining sets of data elements from your
            device’s browser, such as JavaScript objects and installed fonts, to create a “fingerprint” of your device
            and uniquely identify your browser and device.
            <br />
            <br />
            For further information on how we use tracking technologies for analytics, and your rights and choices
            regarding them, see the “Analytics” and “Your Rights and Choices” sections below.
            <br />
            <br />
            Information from Other Sources.
            <br />
            <br />
            We also collect information from other sources. The categories of sources from which we collect
            information include:
            <br />
            <br />

            Social media platforms with which you interact, including our Twitter profile and Discord server.
            Publicly-available sources, including data in the public domain.
            <br />
            <br />

            Third-party services, including from vendors contracted to provide support services related to payments,
            identity verification, anti-money laundering (AML), fraud detection, and other similar services. These
            vendors have their own terms and conditions, privacy policies, and cookie policies. Where they act as a
            controller of your data, they may contact you directly to advise you separately regarding their data
            processing practices. Please contact us for further information regarding our data-processing or datacontrolling vendors.
            <br />
            <br />

            Information on the Blockchain.
            <br />
            <br />

            As part of the Service, we process certain personal data in a blockchain data record. This means that such
            personal data is stored in an immutable blockchain as part of a database called a distributed ledger.
            <br />
            <br />

            Anything stored in a distributed ledger as part of the blockchain may not be changed or deleted. We use
            pseudonymization to reduce the risk to individuals whose personal data is processed in the blockchain.
            <br />
            <br />

            Please carefully review how the use of blockchain with our Service may limit the exercise of certain of
            your rights regarding personal data in the “California” section below.
            <br />
            <br />

            Use of Information.
            <br />

            The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), and its replacement the California Privacy Rights Act
            (“CPRA”), provide additional rights to California residents. This section addresses those rights and applies
            only to California residents. Any rights specifically relating to the CPRA shall not take effect until January
            1, 2023

            Notice of Collection.
            <br />
            <br />
            We have collected the following categories of personal information (as described in the CCPA/CPRA) in
            the past 12 months. For further details on the personal information we collect and how we obtain this
            information, please review the “Information Collection” section above.

            or considered.

            Internet activity, including browsing history, search history, and interactions with a website, email,

            <br />
            <br />
            We collect and use this personal information for the business purposes set out in the “Use of Information”
            section above.
            <br />
            <br />
            We disclose this personal information to the categories of persons set out in the “Disclosure of
            Information” section above.
            <br />
            <br />
            We do not “sell” or “share” your personal information as those terms as defined by the CCPA/CPRA.
            <br />
            <br />
            We do not knowingly sell or share the personal information of minors under 16 years old who are
            California residents.

            Retention.
            <br />
            <br />
            We retain each category of personal information, for the length of time that is reasonably necessary for
            the purpose for which it was collected, and as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve
            disputes, prevent fraud, and enforce our agreements.

            <br />
            <br />
            Right to Know, Correct, and Delete.
            <br />
            <br />
            You have the right to know certain details about our data practices. In particular, you may request the
            following from us:


            <br />
            <br />
            The categories of personal information we have collected about you;
            The categories of sources from which the personal information was collected;
            The categories of personal information about you we disclosed for a business purpose or sold or shared;
            The categories of persons to whom the personal information was disclosed for a business purpose or sold
            or shared;
            The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling or sharing the personal information; and
            The specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.

            <br />
            <br />
            Unless you specify otherwise, the response we provide will cover the 12 month period preceding our
            receipt of the request. Starting with personal information collected on or after January 1, 2022, you may
            request that we disclose details beyond the 12-month period, and we shall do so unless doing so proves
            impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort.
            <br />
            <br />
            In addition, you have the right to correct (effective January 1, 2023) or delete the personal information
            we have collected from you.
            <br />
            <br />
            Our Service may use blockchain technology to store certain personal data, including your digital wallet
            address, time of transactions, and other information that may be used to directly or indirectly identify
            you. In our Service, we may collect other data that enables us to identify you. We use pseudonymization
            in our blockchain records to reduce the risk to individuals whose personal data is processed in the
            blockchain. As a result, the way we respond to a request to exercise certain of your rights (i.e., access,
            correction, and deletion requests) will be limited. We cannot alter information stored in a blockchain, but,
            unless we have a legitimate interest or other valid legal basis in processing your personal data, if you
            request erasure, object to the processing of your personal data, or request that the processing of your
            personal data be limited by us, we will not include your personal data in our Service records that are added
            to the blockchain subsequent to such request. We may not be able to provide you the Service if you
            request that your personal data be deleted or you object to further processing of your personal data.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you request that any such personal data be corrected when we validate the information as being correct,
            we will correct our records, including by creating a new record entry in the blockchain if appropriate.
            Additionally, although we cannot erase your personal data in Service records that have been added to the
            blockchain, we can, when appropriate (i.e., you no longer use the our Service), erase the mapping in our
            <br />
            <br />
            records and/or our service provider records pertaining to you, outside the blockchain in a manner that
            would render the pseudonymized data in the blockchain to be de-identified (anonymized).
            <br />
            <br />
            To exercise any of these rights, please email us at deadbeat@elevate-m.com. In the request, please
            specify which right you are seeking to exercise and the scope of the request. We will confirm receipt of
            your request within 10 days. We may require specific information from you to help us verify your identity
            and process your request. If we are unable to verify your identity, we may deny your request
            <br />

            Authorized Agent
            <br />
            <br />
            You can designate an authorized agent to submit requests on your behalf. However, we will require
            written proof of the agent’s permission to do so and verify your identity directly.

            Right to Non-Discrimination.
            <br />

            Customers who are residents of California may request (i) a list of the categories of personal information
            (as that term is defined by Shine the Light) disclosed by us to third parties during the immediately
            preceding calendar year for those third parties’ own direct marketing purposes; and (ii) a list of the
            categories of third parties to whom we disclosed such information. To exercise a request, please write us
            at the email or postal address set out in “Contact Us” above and specify that you are making a “California
            Shine the Light Request.” We may require additional information from you to allow us to verify your
            identity and are only required to respond to requests once during any calendar year.
